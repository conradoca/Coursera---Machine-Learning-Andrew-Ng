<h1 align="center">Coursera Machine Learning Andrew NG in Python</h1>
Each of these folders contains my own version of the Coursera's <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning">Machine learning</a> course exercises in Python.

My intention is not to replicate exactly the exercises but to have my own flavour of them.
I am also including variations of these exercises based on my own experimentations
üòä.

To complete the exercises I have used some articles from the web that have been inspirational, helpful and many times a step-by-step guide of what to do. I am sincerely thankful to the AI community and the open-source mindset that drives it. I truly believe that this helps to increase the potential of this incredible technology.

Following a description of the exercises plus the techniques and items that I have learned on each of them so it can be used in the future as models for new exercises:
