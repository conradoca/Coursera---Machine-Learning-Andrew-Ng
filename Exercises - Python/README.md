<h1 align="center">Coursera Machine Learning Andrew NG in Python</h1>
Each of these folders contains my own version of the Coursera's course exercises in Python.
My intention is not to replicate exactly the exercises but to have my own flavour of them.
I am also including variations of these exercises based on my own experimentations.
