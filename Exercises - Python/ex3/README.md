I have not stored the MNIST database in the MNIST subfolder to avoid wasting GitHub space.

In order to have this exercise running properly please download the MNIST database files and save the contents within the MNIST folder.
The dataset is available at http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/.

Download:
 - train-images-idx3-ubyte.gz:  training set images (9912422 bytes)
 - train-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz:  training set labels (28881 bytes)
 - t10k-images-idx3-ubyte.gz:   test set images (1648877 bytes)
 - t10k-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz:   test set labels (4542 bytes)

The files are compressed. Then use any ZIP software to decompress these 4 files and store them in /MNIST database/.  

You can also get data importing it from keras (look at https://www.askpython.com/python/examples/load-and-plot-mnist-dataset-in-python).
